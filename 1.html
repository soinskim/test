  <h2>Dieter Rams 디터람스는 누구인가?</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:50px;">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank" title="wiki">
    Dieter Rams<a/> began his studies
    in architecture and interior decoration at Wiesbaden
    School of Art in 1947, now part of the RheinMain
    University of Applied Sciences. A year later, in 1948,
    he took a break from studying to gain practical
    experience and finish his carpentry apprenticeship.
    He returned to the Wiesbaden School of Art in 1948
    and graduated in architecture with honours in 1953,
    after which he began working for Frankfurt-based
    architect Otto Apel. In 1955, he was recruited to
    Braun as an architect and an interior designer.
    In 1961, he<br>
      became the chief design officer at Braun,
    a position he retained until 1995.</p>

  <strong><u>Dieter Rams</u> was strongly influenced by the
    presence of his grandfather, a carpenter.</strong>
    Rams once explained his design approach in the phrase
    "Weniger, aber besser" which translates as "Less,
    but better". Rams and his staff designed many memorable
    products for Braun including the famous SK-4 record
    player and the high-quality 'D'-series (D45, D46)
    of 35mm film slide projectors. He is also known for
    designing a furniture collection for Vitsœ in the
    1960s including the 606 universal shelving system
    and 620 chair programme.
