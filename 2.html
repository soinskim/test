    Marcel Lajos Breuer<a/> was a Hungarian-born modernist architect, and furniture designer.
    At the Bauhaus he designed the Wassily Chair and the Cesca Chair which is
    “among the 10 most important chairs of the 20th century.”[1] Breuer extended the
    sculpture vocabulary he had developed in the carpentry shop at the Bauhaus into
    a personal architecture that made him one of the world's most popular
    architects at the peak of 20th-century design. His work includes art museums,
    libraries, college buildings, office buildings, and residences.
     Many are in a Brutalist architecture style, including the former
     IBM Research and Development facility which was the birthplace of the
     first personal computer.</p>

  <strong><u>Commonly known</u> to his friends and associates as Lajkó
   (/ˈlaɪkoʊ/ LY-koh; the diminutive of his middle name),
</strong>
    [2] Breuer was born in Pécs, Hungary.[3] He left his hometown
      at the age of 18 in search of artistic training and was
      one of the first and youngest students at the Bauhaus
      – a radical arts and crafts school that Walter Gropius
      had founded in Weimar just after the first World War.
      He was recognized by Gropius as a significant
      talent and was quickly put at the head of the
      carpentry shop. Gropius was to remain a lifelong
      mentor for a man who was 19 years his junior.
